# Tristan and Isolde — A Git Dialogue
Isolde: How many have you loved before me?  
Tristan: None, for my heart was waiting to learn your name.  
Isolde: And after me?  
Tristan: After you, the world will feel empty.  
Isolde: Sweet words, but words fade. What remains when love is gone?  
Tristan: Only silence — and the memory of your voice.
